                    <h1> Hi, this is my testing website. Thanks for visiting!</h1>

                    <p>Housing litigator. I represent private, corporate, government, and institutional entities and their legal interests in the residential real estate sector. My current practice in housing law is supplemented with experience in criminal and quasi-criminal defence, family law, and civil/commercial litigation.

                    In the realm of intelligence, I am an analyst with experience in open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, analysis, synthesis, and dissemination. I have a specialized focus on Greater China relations, national security, foreign policy, and cybersecurity.

                    Outside of my career, I find myself keeping up-to-date with current affairs, politics, and the advancements of technology. My pastimes include fitness, travelling, trying new restaurants, playing various types of games, and learning about history, culture, and languages.
